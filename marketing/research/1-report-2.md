# Target Audience and Channel Strategy Report
## Invoice Recovery and Reminders Product

### Executive Summary

Based on my analysis of the invoice recovery and reminders market, I've identified two primary target audiences that offer the greatest potential for your product, along with the most effective channels to reach them. The following strategy focuses on businesses with the most acute payment collection challenges and provides a framework for engaging these audiences through channels where they already seek solutions.

## Target Audience Discovery Strategy

### Methodology for Identification

To identify your ideal customer segments, I recommend a multi-faceted approach:

1. **Data Analysis Framework**
   - Analyze existing customer data from early adopters
   - Review industry reports on payment delinquency rates
   - Conduct competitor customer analysis

2. **Key Segmentation Criteria**
   - Business size (revenue, employee count)
   - Payment volume and average invoice value
   - Current DSO (Days Sales Outstanding) metrics
   - Industry vertical and associated payment norms
   - Technology infrastructure and integration requirements
   - Decision-maker profile (finance role vs. owner-operator)

3. **Prioritization Matrix**
   - Market size (addressable revenue opportunity)
   - Problem severity (financial impact of late payments)
   - Solution fit (alignment with current product capabilities)
   - Acquisition cost and accessibility
   - Growth potential (expansion revenue opportunities)

## Primary Target Audiences

### Segment 1: Service-Based Small Businesses

**Persona Profile**
