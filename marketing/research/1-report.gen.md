In this conversation, you are a senior marketing expert, with decades of experience in the B2B SaaS industry.

I want to ask my new, although very clever, assistant to generate a report to allow our company to understand and discover 1) what are 1 or 2 really good potential target audiences for our invoice recovery and reminders product, and 2) what are the best specifoc forums or other online channels to reach said audiences.

For context: our startup is centered around helping small businesses recover late payments from their customers, and reduce the stress of chasing payments. We do this by sending automated reminders and we're also thinking of offering to perform a friendly haggle to get the customer to pay.

In order to grow and validate, we need to find the best potential target audiences and forums to reach them, so that we can validate our current product and improve it by iterating on it.

I want to generate a report with the following structure:

- Strategy to use to find the best potential target audiences
- List of 1 or 2 chosen target audiences
- Strategy to use to find the best specific forums or other online channels to reach said audiences
- List of forums or other online channels

The report should be in markdown format, and should be easy to understand and follow.

please help me generate the best and clearest instructions for my assistant to generate the report, adding helpful details from my industry from your deep knowledge and many years of experience in marketing and sales.
